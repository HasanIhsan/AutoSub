1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,558
And

2
00:00:00,558 --> 00:00:01,116
of

3
00:00:01,116 --> 00:00:01,674
course

4
00:00:01,674 --> 00:00:02,232
another

5
00:00:02,232 --> 00:00:02,790
type

6
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:03,349
is

7
00:00:03,349 --> 00:00:03,907
the

8
00:00:03,907 --> 00:00:04,465
3-4

9
00:00:04,465 --> 00:00:05,023
words

10
00:00:05,023 --> 00:00:05,581
per

11
00:00:05,581 --> 00:00:06,140
subtitle.

12
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:07,662
I

13
00:00:07,662 --> 00:00:07,965
personally

14
00:00:07,965 --> 00:00:08,268
don't

15
00:00:08,268 --> 00:00:08,570
really

16
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:08,873
like

17
00:00:08,873 --> 00:00:09,176
the

18
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:09,479
3-4

19
00:00:09,479 --> 00:00:09,781
that

20
00:00:09,781 --> 00:00:10,084
you're

21
00:00:10,084 --> 00:00:10,387
seeing

22
00:00:10,387 --> 00:00:10,689
right

23
00:00:10,689 --> 00:00:10,992
now

24
00:00:10,992 --> 00:00:11,295
mainly

25
00:00:11,295 --> 00:00:11,598
because

26
00:00:11,598 --> 00:00:11,900
it's

27
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:12,203
hard

28
00:00:12,203 --> 00:00:12,506
for

29
00:00:12,506 --> 00:00:12,809
me

30
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:13,111
to

31
00:00:13,111 --> 00:00:13,414
actually

32
00:00:13,414 --> 00:00:13,717
subtitle

33
00:00:13,717 --> 00:00:14,019
this.

34
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:14,720
Or

35
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:15,040
rather

36
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:15,360
it's

37
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:15,680
easy

38
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:16,000
for

39
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,320
me

40
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:16,640
to

41
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:16,960
subtitle

42
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:17,280
the

43
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:17,600
3-4

44
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:17,920
but

45
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:18,240
it's...
